1. Overview

This dataset accompanies the GeoMIP (Geometric Approach to the Minimum Information Partition Problem) project and contains all data used to validate the algorithms described in the manuscript.
The data include transition probability matrices (TPMs) generated for different networks and experimental results comparing three reference strategies:

PyPhi (theoretical reference implementation),

Strategy Q (used as reference when PyPhi values are not available), and

GeoMIP (Geometric strategy, proposed in this study), which includes Method 1 and Method 2 variants.

All datasets are provided to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of the reported results.
